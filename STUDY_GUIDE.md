## üí° Tips for Success

### Technical Preparation
1. **Understand, don't memorize**: Focus on concepts, not syntax
2. **Practice coding**: Write code daily, even if just 30 minutes
3. **Build projects**: Hands-on experience is invaluable
4. **Review regularly**: Spaced repetition helps retention

### Interview Strategy
1. **Ask clarifying questions**: Don't assume requirements
2. **Think out loud**: Explain your thought process
3. **Start simple**: Get basic solution working first
4. **Consider edge cases**: Null values, empty lists, errors
5. **Discuss trade-offs**: Show you understand pros/cons

### Banking Context
1. **Always use BigDecimal** for money calculations
2. **Consider compliance** (PCI-DSS, SOX, GLBA)
3. **Think about security** (encryption, audit logs)
4. **High availability** is critical (99.99% uptime)
5. **Transaction idempotency** is essential
