## 💬 Interview Questions

### Quick Access by Category

| Category | Questions | Difficulty |
|----------|-----------|------------|
| 🍃 Spring Boot | 10 questions | ⭐⭐⭐ |
| 🔒 API Security | 10 questions | ⭐⭐⭐⭐ |
| ⚓ Kubernetes | 10 questions | ⭐⭐⭐ |
| ☕ Java Core | 10 questions | ⭐⭐⭐ |
| 🏦 Banking Domain | 10 questions | ⭐⭐⭐⭐ |
| 🚀 CI/CD | 5 questions | ⭐⭐ |
| 🎯 Scenario-Based | 10 questions | ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ |

### Sample Questions

<details>
<summary><b>Spring Boot: How do you set different profiles?</b></summary>

**Answer**: Multiple ways to set Spring profiles:

1. **application.properties**: `spring.profiles.active=prod`
2. **Environment variable**: `SPRING_PROFILES_ACTIVE=prod`
3. **Command line**: `java -jar app.jar --spring.profiles.active=prod`
4. **Programmatically**: `SpringApplication.setAdditionalProfiles("prod")`

**Banking Context**: Use different profiles for dev, test, UAT, and production environments with different database connections, API endpoints, and security configurations.

</details>

<details>
<summary><b>API Security: Explain mTLS and why banks use it</b></summary>

**Answer**: Mutual TLS (mTLS) is two-way authentication where both client and server verify each other's identity using certificates.

**Why banks use it:**
- Zero-trust security model
- Service-to-service authentication
- PCI-DSS compliance requirement
- Prevents man-in-the-middle attacks
- Non-repudiation (cryptographic proof)

**Example**: Payment service authenticating with account service using client certificates.

</details>

<details>
<summary><b>Kubernetes: What happens when a pod crashes?</b></summary>

**Answer**: 
1. Kubernetes detects pod failure via liveness probe
2. ReplicaSet controller notices desired vs actual state mismatch
3. Scheduler creates new pod on available node
4. New pod starts and passes readiness probe
5. Service routes traffic to new pod
6. Old pod is terminated and removed

**Banking Impact**: Ensures high availability for critical services like payment processing.

## 🏦 Banking & Financial Services Focus

### Regulatory Compliance

| Regulation | Purpose | Key Requirements |
|------------|---------|------------------|
| **PCI-DSS** | Payment card data protection | Encryption, access control, monitoring |
| **SOX** | Financial reporting accuracy | Audit trails, change management |
| **GLBA** | Customer privacy | Data protection, disclosure policies |
| **KYC/AML** | Customer verification | Identity verification, transaction monitoring |

### Banking Domain Scenarios

#### 1. Payment Processing
```java
// High-volume, low-latency payment processing
// Requirements: ACID transactions, idempotency, audit logging
@Service
public class PaymentService {
    @Transactional
    public PaymentResponse processPayment(PaymentRequest request) {
        // Idempotency check
        // Balance validation
        // Fraud detection
        // Transaction execution
        // Audit logging
    }
}
```

#### 2. Fraud Detection
```java
// Real-time fraud detection using Streams API
List<Transaction> suspiciousTransactions = transactions.stream()
    .filter(t -> t.getAmount() > 10000)
    .filter(t -> t.isInternational())
    .filter(t -> t.getTimestamp().isAfter(lastTransaction.plusMinutes(5)))
    .collect(Collectors.toList());
```

#### 3. Account Management
- Balance inquiries (high read volume)
- Transaction history (pagination, filtering)
- Account updates (ACID compliance)
- Statement generation (batch processing)

### Common Banking Challenges

| Challenge | Solution |
|-----------|----------|
| **High Availability** | Multi-region deployment, circuit breakers |
| **Data Consistency** | Distributed transactions, saga pattern |
| **Security** | mTLS, encryption, zero-trust architecture |
| **Compliance** | Audit logging, data retention, access control |
| **Performance** | Caching, async processing, database optimization |
