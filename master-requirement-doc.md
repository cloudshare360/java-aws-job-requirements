## ðŸ§© Organized & Categorized Breakdown

### 1. **CI/CD & Build Automation**
- GitHub Actions
- Jenkins Pipeline

### 2. **Spring Boot**
- Core concepts and configuration
- Common annotations:
  - `@Entity`
  - `@Configuration`
  - JPA-related annotations
- Setting **Spring Profiles**:
  - `application-{profile}.properties` / `.yml`
  - `spring.profiles.active` via env var, CLI, or config file
- Managing **environment properties**:
  - Externalized configuration (files, env vars, command line)

### 3. **Spring Security**
- Interceptors and Filters
- Securing applications and APIs
- Authentication & Authorization mechanisms

### 4. **Cloud & Kubernetes (OpenShift Focus)**
- Deploying Spring Boot apps to cloud (especially OpenShift)
- Kubernetes fundamentals:
  - What is a **Pod**?
  - How to **bring down a Pod**:
    ```sh
    oc delete pod <pod-name>  # OpenShift CLI
    kubectl delete pod <pod-name>  # Kubernetes (if needed)
    ```
- Resource management:
  - Setting **CPU limits**
  - Setting **memory limits** (via `resources.limits` in DeploymentConfig or Pod spec)

### 5. **API Design & Security**
- Securing API connections
- **mTLS (mutual TLS)** for service-to-service authentication
- REST semantics:
  - **PUT vs POST**: idempotency, resource creation vs update

### 6. **Core Java**
- Basic **Java Stream** questions
- Brush up on functional programming features (e.g., `map`, `filter`, `collect`)

> ðŸ’¡ **Usage Tip**:  
> - Use the **Raw** section to ensure nothing from the original ask is lost.  
> - Use the **Organized** section for study planning, flashcards, or mock interview prep.  
> - Commit this file to your Git repo (e.g., `docs/job-prep-topics.md`) for versioned tracking.
