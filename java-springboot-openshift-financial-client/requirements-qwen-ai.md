Absolutely! Below is a **clean, structured, and logically organized** version of your original content—grouped by **theme**, **dependency**, and **learning flexibility**.

- Topics that **build on each other** are ordered sequentially.  
- **Independent topics** are grouped under clear headings so you can **switch between them** when bored or blocked.  
- Your **original requirements** are preserved in a dedicated section.

## 📋 **Original Requirements (as provided)**  
> *“GitHub actions, Jenkins pipeline, Spring Boot, Spring Security, Spring interceptors, filters, some common annotations like @Entity, @Configuration, JPA. How to set profiles in Spring Boot? How to set environment properties in Spring Boot? CPU limits, memory limits. We use OpenShift here—so few Q on Kubernetes: how to deploy on cloud, what are pods and how to bring down pods? mTLS connections. How to secure API connections? PUT vs POST. Basic Java stream questions.”*

## 🧱 **Structured Learning Plan**

### 🔹 **I. Core Spring Boot (Foundation – Learn First)**
> *These are prerequisites for everything else in the Java/Spring stack.*

- How to set **Spring Boot profiles**  
  (`application-{profile}.yml`, `--spring.profiles.active`, `@Profile`)
- How to set **external/environment properties**  
  (property precedence, `@ConfigurationProperties`, env vars, config maps)
- Common **annotations**:  
  - `@Entity`, `@Table`, `@Id` (JPA)  
  - `@Configuration`, `@Bean`, `@Component`, `@Service`, `@RestController`
- **Spring Boot with JPA/Hibernate**  
  (Repositories, `JpaRepository`, basic CRUD)

> ✅ *Do this first—everything else assumes Spring Boot knowledge.*

---

### 🔹 **II. Web Layer & API Design (Independent Module)**
> *Can be studied after Core Spring Boot; standalone for API-focused roles.*

- **PUT vs POST** semantics (idempotency, resource creation vs update)
- **Spring Web**: `@RequestMapping`, path variables, request/response handling
- **Filters vs Interceptors**  
  - `javax.servlet.Filter` (low-level, pre-controller)  
  - `HandlerInterceptor` (Spring MVC level, access to handler method)
- **Basic Java Streams** (high-yield for interviews):  
  `filter()`, `map()`, `collect()`, `Collectors`, terminal vs intermediate ops

> 💡 *Switch here if you want a break from infra/cloud topics.*

---

### 🔹 **III. Security (Depends on Web Layer)**
> *Builds on Spring Web; essential for enterprise apps.*

- **Spring Security basics**:  
  - Securing endpoints, JWT/OAuth2 setup  
  - `SecurityFilterChain` (modern config)  
  - Method security: `@PreAuthorize`
- **Securing API connections**:  
  - HTTPS/TLS (enforced at gateway or ingress)  
  - Input validation, rate limiting, auth headers
- **mTLS (Mutual TLS)**:  
  - Used for service-to-service auth in zero-trust networks  
  - Typically handled by **service mesh (Istio)** or **OpenShift sidecars**, not app code

> ⚠️ *Understand mTLS conceptually—you likely won’t implement it in Spring Boot directly.*

---

### 🔹 **IV. Cloud & OpenShift / Kubernetes (Independent Module)**
> *Infrastructure-focused; can be learned in parallel with Java topics.*

- **What is a Pod?**  
  Smallest deployable unit (1+ containers, shared network/volume)
- **How to deploy on cloud (OpenShift)**:  
  - Use `oc new-app` or YAML (`Deployment` + `Service` + `Route`)  
  - Never deploy bare Pods—use controllers (Deployment)
- **How to bring down Pods**:  
  - ✅ Safe: `oc scale deployment/my-app --replicas=0`  
  - ❌ Avoid: `oc delete pod` (recreated automatically if managed)
- **CPU & Memory limits**:  
  - CPU: `500m` = 0.5 core; Memory: `512Mi`, `1Gi`  
  - Set in `resources.limits` in Deployment YAML  
  - JVM respects limits in Java ≥8u191 / 11+ / 17+

> 🌩️ *This is critical for your OpenShift environment—study alongside CI/CD.*

---

### 🔹 **V. CI/CD Pipelines (Independent Module)**
> *Tooling-focused; minimal Java knowledge needed.*

- **GitHub Actions**:  
  Workflow structure (`on`, `jobs`, `steps`), build → test → deploy
- **Jenkins Pipeline**:  
  Declarative syntax, stages (`build`, `test`, `deploy`), using `oc` CLI in pipeline

> 🔁 *Great “switch topic” when tired of coding—focus on automation logic.*

## 🔄 **Learning Strategy Tips**

- **Start with Section I (Core Spring Boot)**—it’s foundational.
- After that, **freely jump between II, III, IV, V** based on energy/mood.
- **Java Streams (II)** and **PUT vs POST (II)** are quick wins—review early for interviews.
- **OpenShift (IV)** and **CI/CD (V)** are highly relevant to your current job—prioritize if deploying soon.
- **mTLS (III)**: Know the *what* and *why*, not deep implementation.

This structure gives you **focus when needed** and **flexibility when bored**—while ensuring nothing from your original list is missed.
