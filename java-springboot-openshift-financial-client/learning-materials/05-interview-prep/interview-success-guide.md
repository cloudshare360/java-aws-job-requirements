## 🎯 **Key Concepts Mastery**

### **Must-Know Java Concepts**

#### **Collections & Streams**
```java
// Be ready to explain and code
List<Employee> engineers = employees.stream()
    .filter(emp -> "Engineering".equals(emp.getDepartment()))
    .sorted(Comparator.comparing(Employee::getSalary).reversed())
    .limit(5)
    .collect(Collectors.toList());

// Explain: Stream pipeline, lazy evaluation, collectors
```

#### **Concurrency**
```java
// Understand thread safety, synchronization
private final Object lock = new Object();

public void updateCounter() {
    synchronized(lock) {
        counter++;
    }
}

// Discuss: volatile, atomic operations, ConcurrentHashMap
```

### **Must-Know Spring Boot Concepts**

#### **Dependency Injection**
```java
@Service
public class UserService {
    private final UserRepository userRepository;
    
    // Constructor injection (preferred)
    public UserService(UserRepository userRepository) {
        this.userRepository = userRepository;
    }
}

// Explain: Constructor vs field vs setter injection
```

#### **Configuration**
```java
@ConfigurationProperties(prefix = "app")
@Component
public class AppConfig {
    private String name;
    private int timeout;
    // getters and setters
}

// application.yml
app:
  name: MyApp
  timeout: 30

// Explain: Property binding, profiles, externalized config
```

### **Must-Know REST API Concepts**

```java
@RestController
@RequestMapping("/api/users")
public class UserController {
    
    @PostMapping  // Create new resource
    public ResponseEntity<User> createUser(@RequestBody User user) {
        // Server assigns ID, returns 201 Created
    }
    
    @PutMapping("/{id}")  // Create or replace
    public ResponseEntity<User> updateUser(@PathVariable Long id, 
                                          @RequestBody User user) {
        // Client specifies ID, idempotent
    }
}

// Explain: Idempotency, status codes, resource design
```

### **Must-Know Cloud/DevOps Concepts**

#### **Kubernetes Deployment**
```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: spring-boot-app
spec:
  replicas: 3
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: spring-boot-app
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: spring-boot-app

| **Mistake** | **Why It's Bad** | **How to Avoid** |
|-------------|------------------|------------------|
| Not asking clarifying questions | Shows lack of analytical thinking | Always ask "What if..." scenarios |
| Jumping to code immediately | Misses problem understanding | Think out loud, discuss approach first |
| Not testing solution | Shows poor software practices | Walk through test cases |
| Not discussing trade-offs | Misses architectural thinking | Always mention pros/cons |
| Over-engineering simple problems | Shows poor judgment | Start simple, then optimize |

### **Communication Mistakes**
| **Mistake** | **Impact** | **Solution** |
|-------------|------------|--------------|
| Speaking too fast/quietly | Hard to follow | Practice speaking clearly |
| Not explaining reasoning | Seems like guessing | Think out loud |
| Getting defensive about mistakes | Shows poor collaboration | Accept feedback gracefully |
| Not admitting knowledge gaps | Seems dishonest | Say "I don't know, but I'd research..." |
| Dominating conversation | Poor collaboration signal | Listen actively, ask questions |
