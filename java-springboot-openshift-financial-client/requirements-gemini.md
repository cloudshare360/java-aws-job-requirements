It is essential to organize your learning plan to ensure efficiency and combat learning fatigue. Based on your request, I have structured these topics into logical, independent sections, prioritizing the core development skills (Java/Spring Boot) before the deployment and architectural concepts (DevOps/Kubernetes) which will utilize them.

Here is the structured and reformatted learning content:

## üìù **I. Core Learning Requirements**

These are the specific questions and topics you need to master. This section serves as your checklist.

### Questions for Focus:
* How to set profiles in Spring Boot?
* How to set environment properties in Spring Boot?
* How to deploy on cloud (Kubernetes/OpenShift)?
* What are pods and how to bring down pods (in Kubernetes)?
* How to secure API connections (including mTLS)?
* PUT vs POST (HTTP methods).
* Basic Java stream Qs (Questions).

### Topics to Master:
* GitHub Actions
* Jenkins Pipeline
* Spring Boot (General)
* Spring Security
* Spring Interceptors, Filters, some common annotations like `@Entity`, `@Configuration`, `@JPA` (for Spring Data JPA).
* CPU limits and memory limits (for containers).
* mTLS connections.

## ‚òï **II. Java Core and Streams**

This section focuses on the foundational Java concepts, particularly streams, which are essential for modernizing your backend code.

### 1. Java Stream API
* **Basic Java stream Qs:** Focus on understanding the core components of the Stream API, including:
    * Creating streams (from collections, arrays, and I/O).
    * Intermediate operations (`filter`, `map`, `sorted`, `distinct`).
    * Terminal operations (`collect`, `forEach`, `reduce`).
    * The difference between sequential and parallel streams.

### 2. HTTP Fundamentals
* **PUT vs POST:** Understand the semantics, idempotency, and common use cases for each HTTP method. This is crucial for designing correct RESTful APIs.

## ‚öôÔ∏è **III. Spring Boot and Backend Development**

This is your primary backend development section. Focus on learning the latest configurations and security standards, especially as they relate to Microservices.

### 1. Spring Boot Core Configuration
* **How to set profiles in Spring Boot:** Learn about the purpose of profiles, how to activate them (e.g., `application-dev.properties`), and how to set them via command line or environment variables.
* **How to set environment properties in Spring Boot:** Understand the Spring Boot Externalized Configuration mechanism, including the order of precedence for properties (command line arguments, environment variables, configuration files, etc.).
* **Common Annotations:** Review essential annotations:
    * `@Entity`, `@Table` (JPA/Hibernate mapping).
    * `@Configuration` (defining configuration classes).
    * `@SpringBootApplication` (the main entry point).

### 2. Spring Web and Security
* **Spring Security:** Focus on configuration for REST APIs: OAuth2/JWT integration, securing endpoints (`@PreAuthorize`), and configuring security filters.
* **Spring Interceptors, Filters:** Understand the processing pipeline of an HTTP request in a Spring application and when to use a **Filter** (Servlet layer) versus an **Interceptor** (Spring layer).

## ‚òÅÔ∏è **IV. Cloud-Native Architecture & DevOps**

This section addresses how your code is built, deployed, and secured in a cloud environment, which ties directly into your Architect profile.

### 1. CI/CD Pipeline Automation
* **Jenkins Pipeline:** Focus on creating declarative pipelines to build, test, and deploy Spring Boot applications.
* **GitHub Actions:** Learn how to use GitHub's native CI/CD tool to automate workflows, including compiling code, running tests, and publishing Docker images.

### 2. Containerization and Orchestration (Kubernetes/OpenShift)
* **Kubernetes Fundamentals:** Address the core questions:
    * **What are pods and how to bring down pods:** Understand a Pod as the smallest deployable unit, and the methods for controlled shutdown (e.g., scaling down deployments or using `kubectl delete pod`).
    * **How to deploy on cloud:** Learn about creating Deployment objects, Services (LoadBalancers, NodePorts), and Ingress resources in Kubernetes/OpenShift.
* **Resource Management:**
    * **CPU limits, memory limits:** Understand how setting `requests` and `limits` in Kubernetes resource definitions affects scheduling and prevents noisy neighbors.

### 3. API Security & Communication
* **How to secure API connections:**
    * **mTLS connections (Mutual TLS):** Understand the concept of mTLS where both the client and server verify each other's certificates. This is often implemented at the API Gateway or using a Service Mesh (like Istio/Linkerd) in Kubernetes.
    * **General Security:** Review topics like rate limiting, input validation, and using authentication protocols (like O-Auth, which is listed on your resume).
