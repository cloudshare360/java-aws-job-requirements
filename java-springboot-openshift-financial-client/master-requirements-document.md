- **DELETE** - Remove resource

#### **3. Sequential Interview Challenge Questions**
**Level 1**: Foundation questions (build confidence)
**Level 2**: Practical application scenarios
**Level 3**: Misleading/trick questions with confident responses
**Level 4**: Advanced system design scenarios
**Level 5**: Real-world complexity challenges
**Level 6**: Confidence destroyer questions with rock-solid answers

#### **4. Confidence-Building Strategies**
