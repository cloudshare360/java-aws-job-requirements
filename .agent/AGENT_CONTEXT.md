## Agent Decision Points

### Key Decisions Made
1. **Structure**: Organized by topic rather than by bank
2. **Depth**: Comprehensive with code examples vs. brief overview
3. **Focus**: Banking-specific scenarios throughout
4. **Format**: Markdown with code blocks for readability
5. **Examples**: Complete, runnable code vs. pseudocode

### Trade-offs Considered
- **Breadth vs. Depth**: Chose depth with comprehensive examples
- **Theory vs. Practice**: Balanced with code examples
- **Generic vs. Specific**: Banking-specific throughout
- **Concise vs. Complete**: Chose completeness for interview prep

## Recovery & Continuation

### If Session Interrupted
1. Read this AGENT_CONTEXT.md file first
2. Check AGENT_MEMORY.md for last state
3. Review CONVERSATION_TRACKER.md for user intent
4. Check PROJECT_STATUS.md for completion status
5. Review git log for recent changes

### If Continuing Work
1. Check TASK_LIST.md for pending items
2. Review last completed task in AGENT_MEMORY.md
3. Understand user's next request
4. Update tracking documents as you work
5. Commit changes regularly

### If Starting New Task
1. Understand relationship to existing content
2. Maintain consistency with established patterns
3. Update all relevant tracking documents
4. Follow banking domain context
5. Include code examples where applicable
