## Quick Start for New Agent

### If Continuing This Project:

1. **Read in Order**:
   ```
   1. AGENT_CONTEXT.md     (What is this project?)
   2. CONVERSATION_TRACKER.md (What did user want?)
   3. AGENT_MEMORY.md      (What's the current state?)
   4. PROJECT_REQUIREMENTS.md (What needs to be done?)
   5. AGENT_WORKFLOW.md    (How should I work?)
   ```

2. **Check Status**:
   ```bash
   git status
   git log --oneline -5
   cat ../PROJECT_STATUS.md
   ```

3. **Understand Context**:
   - Project is 100% complete
   - All metadata created
   - User may have stepped away
   - Session may have timed out

4. **Next Actions**:
   - Wait for user's return
   - Or continue if new tasks assigned
   - Maintain all context
   - Follow protocols in AGENT_WORKFLOW.md

3. Review git log
4. Continue from last checkpoint

### Scenario 2: User Returns
**What Happened**: User stepped away and came back  
**Recovery**:
1. Greet user
2. Summarize current state
3. Ask for next instructions
4. Continue work

### Scenario 3: New Task
**What Happened**: User has new requirements  
**Recovery**:
1. Understand relationship to existing work
2. Update CONVERSATION_TRACKER.md
