# Interview Questions - Senior Java Developer (Banking)

## Spring Boot & Microservices

### Q1: How do you set different profiles in Spring Boot?
**Answer**: Multiple ways:
- `application.properties`: `spring.profiles.active=prod`
- Environment variable: `SPRING_PROFILES_ACTIVE=prod`
- Command line: `java -jar app.jar --spring.profiles.active=prod`
- Programmatically: `SpringApplication.setAdditionalProfiles("prod")`

### Q2: Explain the difference between @RestController and @Controller
**Answer**: 
- `@RestController` = `@Controller` + `@ResponseBody`
- `@RestController` returns data (JSON/XML), not views
- Used for REST APIs in microservices

### Q3: How do you handle exceptions globally in Spring Boot?
**Answer**: Use `@ControllerAdvice` with `@ExceptionHandler`
```java
@ControllerAdvice
public class GlobalExceptionHandler {
    @ExceptionHandler(PaymentException.class)
    public ResponseEntity<ErrorResponse> handlePaymentException(PaymentException ex) {
        return ResponseEntity.status(HttpStatus.BAD_REQUEST)
            .body(new ErrorResponse(ex.getMessage()));
    }
}
```

### Q4: What's the difference between Spring Interceptor and Filter?
**Answer**:
- **Filter**: Servlet API, executes before/after servlet, access to request/response
- **Interceptor**: Spring MVC, executes before/after controller, access to handler and ModelAndView
- Use Filter for security, logging; Interceptor for business logic

### Q5: How do you implement circuit breaker in Spring Boot?
**Answer**: Use Resilience4j
```java
@CircuitBreaker(name = "paymentService", fallbackMethod = "fallbackPayment")
public PaymentResponse processPayment(PaymentRequest request) {
    return externalPaymentGateway.process(request);
}
```

## API Security

### Q6: Explain mTLS and why banks use it
**Answer**: Mutual TLS - both client and server authenticate using certificates
- **Why banks use it**: Zero-trust security, service-to-service authentication, PCI-DSS compliance
- Prevents man-in-the-middle attacks
- Non-repudiation (cryptographic proof)

### Q7: What's the difference between POST and PUT?
**Answer**:
- **POST**: Create new resource, non-idempotent, returns 201 Created
- **PUT**: Update/replace resource, idempotent, returns 200 OK or 204 No Content
- Example: POST /accounts (create), PUT /accounts/123 (update)

### Q8: How do you secure sensitive data in application.properties?
**Answer**:
- Use HashiCorp Vault or AWS Secrets Manager

## Kubernetes & OpenShift

### Q11: What is a Pod in Kubernetes?
**Answer**: Smallest deployable unit, can contain one or more containers
- Shares network namespace (same IP)
- Shares storage volumes
- Scheduled together on same node
- Lifecycle managed as single unit

### Q12: How do you scale pods in Kubernetes?
**Answer**:
- Manual: `kubectl scale deployment payment-service --replicas=5`
- Horizontal Pod Autoscaler (HPA): Auto-scale based on CPU/memory
- Vertical Pod Autoscaler (VPA): Adjust resource requests/limits

### Q13: Explain CPU and Memory limits
**Answer**:
- **Request**: Guaranteed resources, used for scheduling
- **Limit**: Maximum resources before throttling (CPU) or OOMKilled (memory)
- CPU measured in millicores (1000m = 1 core)
- Memory in Mi/Gi
- Set limits to prevent resource exhaustion

### Q14: How do you bring down a pod safely?
**Answer**:
- `kubectl delete pod <name>` - graceful termination (30s default)
- `kubectl scale deployment <name> --replicas=0` - scale down
- `kubectl drain <node>` - evict all pods from node
- Implement graceful shutdown in application

### Q15: What's the difference between liveness and readiness probes?
**Answer**:
- **Liveness**: Is container running? If fails, restart container
- **Readiness**: Is container ready for traffic? If fails, remove from service endpoints
- Example: Liveness checks app health, Readiness checks DB connection

## Java Fundamentals

### Q16: How do you filter and sum transactions using Streams?
**Answer**:
```java
BigDecimal total = transactions.stream()
    .filter(t -> t.getDate().equals(LocalDate.now()))
    .filter(t -> t.getStatus() == Status.COMPLETED)
    .map(Transaction::getAmount)
    .reduce(BigDecimal.ZERO, BigDecimal::add);
```

### Q17: Why use BigDecimal instead of double for money?
**Answer**: 
- Floating-point precision errors: `0.1 + 0.2 != 0.3`
- BigDecimal provides exact decimal arithmetic
- Always set scale and rounding mode
- Critical for financial calculations

### Q18: Explain ConcurrentHashMap vs HashMap
**Answer**:
- **HashMap**: Not thread-safe, faster for single-threaded
- **ConcurrentHashMap**: Thread-safe, lock-free reads, segment locking for writes
- Use ConcurrentHashMap for caching in multi-threaded banking apps

### Q19: How do you prevent deadlock in payment processing?
**Answer**:
- Always acquire locks in same order
- Use timeouts: `lock.tryLock(5, TimeUnit.SECONDS)`
- Minimize lock duration
- Consider lock-free algorithms
- Example: Lock accounts in alphabetical order

### Q20: What's the difference between map() and flatMap()?
**Answer**:
- **map()**: One-to-one transformation, `Stream<T>` â†’ `Stream<R>`
- **flatMap()**: One-to-many transformation, flattens nested streams
- Example: `customers.flatMap(c -> c.getAccounts().stream())`

### Q22: Explain ACID properties in banking transactions
**Answer**:
